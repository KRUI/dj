Description: Some sites need the ability to broadcast an announcement to all of their
        users. django-announcements was created precisely for this reason. How you
        present the announcement is up to you as the site-developer. When working with
        announcements that are presented on the website one feature is that they are
        only viewed once. A session variable will hold which announcements an user has
        viewed and exclude that from their display. announcements supports two
        different types of filtering of announcements:
        
        * site-wide (this can be presented to anonymous users)
        * non site-wide (these can be used a strictly a mailing if so desired)
        * members only (announcements are filtered based on the value of
        ``request.user``)
