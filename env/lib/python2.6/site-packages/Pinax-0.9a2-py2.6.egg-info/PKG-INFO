        Introduction
        ============
        
        Pinax is an MIT-licensed, open-source platform built on the Django Web
        Framework.
        
        By integrating numerous reusable Django apps and providing starter projects
        and infrastructure tools, Pinax takes care of the things that many sites
        have in common so you can focus on what makes your site different.
        
        Pinax has been used for everything from social networks to corporate websites
        and from intranets to online games. We are also working on number of editions
        tailored to event management, learning management, software project management
        and more.
