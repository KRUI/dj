Description: A Pinax theme based on Twitter's Bootstrap
        ==========================================
        
        
        Quick Start
        -----------
        
        Include "pinax-theme-bootstrap" in your requirements file and
        "pinax_theme_bootstrap" in your INSTALLED APPS.
        
        Make sure both template loaders and staticfiles finders includes
        app directories.
        
        Site name comes from Sites fixture.
        
        Your "site_base.html" should extend "theme_base.html" and should provide
        "footer" and "nav" blocks (the latter should just be a ul of li of a links).
        
        Your pages should have blocks "head_title" and "body" and should extend
        "site_base.html".
        
        The url name "home" should be defined as the homepage.
        
        
        Forms
        -----
        
        To style forms,
        
        {% load bootstrap_tags %}
        
        and do something like:
        
        <form method="POST" action="">
        {% csrf_token %}
        <fieldset>
        {{ form|as_bootstrap }}
        </fieldset>
        <div class="actions">
        <button type="submit" class="btn primary">Submit</button>
        </div>
        </form>
        
        
        Todo / Issues
        -------------
        
        * build additional templates for other apps (possibly as add-ons)
        * include LESS source files here
        * username on secondary nav has to be an anchor for boostrap styling but if
        there is no profile, what could it link to?
